Following Wayne's comment about potential water in the crankcase, I took the engine apart. I have to say, this was much easier than I was expecting. The only major issue was getting the spanner into some places around the base of the cyclinder casings.

Once I had both casings popped off (pistons now showing), I saw no rust. I dangled some paper towel down into the oil in the crankcase. Not that I know what I'm looking for, but there didn't seem to be any water. I got the lawnmower oil pump and sucked the oil out of both sides of the crankcase. Just dirty old oil. 

After extracting as much oil as possible, I added some of the monograde SAE40. Note that these engines don't have a sump, as so you need very little oil. I actually put too much (being worried about lubrication), and (spoiler alert) it took about 10 minutes of running to burn off the extra once the engine was running.

The gasketts were all broken, and so I cut new ones by just tracing the various engine parts. 

> `Note to self` I thought there was only one kind of gaskett paper, and I used stuff that was too thin. Try to match with the old stuff. 

I put the engine back together. I tried starting it and it actually ran, but water wasn't coming through, and so I got nervous about heat (which I realise now isn't a huge issue if running for 5 or so minutes). It would only run occassionally and only for about 20 seconds...

While my parents were staying, I pulled the engine apart again and replace the gaskett paper with thicker stuff (0.8 mm I think). When I put the engine back together and tried starting it, it just backfired like crazy, mostly through the carburettor...

I couldn't work out what I'd done wrong. I tried refitting the carby; I tried the fuel needle, throttle and air. Wouldn't start. Just backfired repeatedly under the power of the starter motor.
