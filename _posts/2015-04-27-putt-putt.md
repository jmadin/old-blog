title: Buying a Boat...
---

I'm pretty certain I'll be buying a boat from our neighbor this week. It's what is called a putt putt.  It has a inboard Blaxland Chapman engine and a rudder - a classic. However, it's been out of the water for about two years, and so will need some work. Luckily, I've been looking for a project.
