title: Finally got it going
---

Today, I went back to Lacey Marine. Wayne was busy out in Pittwater (a boat engine stuck running or something). Jeremy helped out instead. He asked a few questions and realised the problem almost immediately: when I put the part than runs the magneto back on the engine, I paid no attention to its position... so the timing was way out and sparks firing when the fuel/air input was open. You can probably imagine how I felt. When I put the engine back together the first time, I must have fluked approximately the right position, because it was (kind of) running, and so I didn't even think this was an issue the second time (as apparent as it is to everyone else).

> `Timing tip to self` The right position? The line on the flywheel directly up (rough place in picture below), and the ball in the magneto matching the line on the sleeve (two arrow in picture). Pretty obvious in retrospect.

Jeremy then looked inside the magneto and thought the spark gap was too big. He took it into the workshop, undid the two screws and used a flat plate tool of 0.012 inch to get the gap right (when in open position). This was fiddly.

It started.  Felt good. But smoke everywhere, which was probably because I had put too much oil in the crankcase. Jeremy (and by this stage Frank, an old engine enthusiast) told me that it would eventually burn off, and so not a big deal. Just need to periodically clean the spark plugs, whichwere blackening up very quickly.

> `Oil tip to self` Don't overfill the crankcase. These engines don't have sumps and so this is easy to do.

I had taken the exhaust system apart a few weeks before, because it was full of crud. Jeremy got some scrap bit of exhaust pipe and I jimmy-jammed up a pipe out of the boat into a bucket. I had already attached a hose to the water intake under the boat, which I put in a bucket of water.

> `Note to self` I was very worried about gravity pushing water back into the engine if the engine stopped (because I'd removed the water lift muffler). Apparently this is not a big deal. The relatively small amount of water that comes through is easily pushed out by the engine exhaust.

By this stage the session was over, but they were happy for my to run the oil out, and so I thought I was on my own. However, Frank had become hooked - got to love these guys' passion. He was full of extremely useful tips. Before long we realised no water was coming through. So he undid the part running into the first water valve near the flywheel, which was full of eel grass and the guass was blocked. After clearing this, we were getting water through, and let it run for 15 minutes. The smoke eventually disappeared as they said it would.

> `Tip to self` There is a little water filter just before the first value (see arrow in picture below). To clear, unscrew the pipe where the arrow is.

Jeremy came back and the two of them got it running smoothly. Basically, it had started backfiring again, which means too much air relative to fuel. Jeremy opened the fuel needle another half turn and the backfiring stopped. Frank screwed in the throttle screw slightly, and the idling engine sounds great. Can't say how happy I was.

> `Tip to self` Backfiring means not enough fuel. Or, in my earlier case, the timing is wrong!

Frank asked Wayne to give me a long piece of his copper pipe for the exhaust. I own Wayne a six pack of New. Frank said to come back and he'd weld it on to the current pipes and take the exhaust out the back.
