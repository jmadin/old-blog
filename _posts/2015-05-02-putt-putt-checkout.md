title: Checking the boat out
---

I went to look at the boat today, and make sure all the engine parts were there (because I had read they are getting harder to find).

It's called the Admiral.  Liz wants me to change it to Colonel, because I'm a Kentucky Colonel (a long story), but that would be bad luck, right?

Nice comfy seats, but some damage to the braces that hold the middle seat to the side of the boat.

The bow area looks really nice. I already love this boat.

Nice old brass fuel tank.

The engine box.  All the wood needs sanding and re-sealing.

It has a Blaxland Chapman "pup" two-stoke engine. It's a twin, so I believe I'll get up to 7HP out of this baby. I tried to turn the fly-wheel, but not moving... must be seized inside.

The magneto was missing, but Lorraine said it was up at the house in a dry place.

Gearbox look fine, and the stick moves easily back and forward.
