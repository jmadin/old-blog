title: Getting some help
---

I booked an hour with a mechanic at Lacey Marine at the Royal Prince Alfred Yatch Club. I felt like a needed someone familiar with engines to show me around and try to get it running.

Wayne (the mechanic) went through the fuel system first. I learned that having fresh fuel is important. I had been trying to start it with the fuel left in there from six months ago.

I mixed monograde SAE40 oil that Lacey sell with the highest octane fuel available (98). Apparently it's not good to use 10% ethanol fuels (90), because the ethanol can bind with water more easily and not so good for the piston rings (plus some other reasons, but the message was clear). The ratio is 32:1 fuel to oil.

Wayne drained the carburettor and cleaned it out. I cleaned the glass thingy that traps any water up near the fuel tank as well as the little filter. Wayne explained the carburretor to me. The float inside was fine. So looking good as far as fuel supply. 

> `Carby tips` Open the fuel needle about 3/4 turn to start with. This might need more or less once the engine is running. The air intake "screws" is not terribly important, but can be tinkered with later if necessary.

Next, I attached the magneto, and Wayne took the spark plugs out and held them against the top of the engine with a screw driver. I ran the starter motor and we saw the sparks clearly, even in daylight.

With spark plugs back in, we tried starting the engine. To my surprise it actually coughed and spluttered a bit (as in fuel was burning), but it wouldn't start. Wayne tried turning the flywheel by hand and said it shouldn't be so stiff. He then told me it was probably rusting in the cylinders, meaning that water must have got in the crank case. He said I'd need to open it up and take a look.

That was the end of the session. Have to say, I thought it was all over...
