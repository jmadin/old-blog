I'm an academic at [Macquarie University](http://www.mq.edu.au) in Sydney, where I have a [lab](http://acropora.bio.mq.edu.au) that focuses on quantitative ecology, biophysics and informatics.

My big academic challenges at the moment are:

  * Effects of storm waves on coral reefs
  * The [Coral Trait Database](https://coraltraits.org)
  * Coral biogeographical range shifts
